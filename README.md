# The Odin Project - Landing Page Project

## Description
The Odin Project - Landing Page Project

For this project, I used HTML and CSS to build a simple landing page from a pre-existing design provided by the Odin Project. Almost all of the content in this webpage is dummy content except for the photos. This webpage includes essential landing page sections such as a header, a hero, an information section with photos, a quote, a call to action, and a footer.

## Some Problems I Ran Into

The biggest problem I had was deciding how to layer my flexboxes. For example, in the hero section I initially had the "hero" div to hold all the content. Then inside that two divs, one for the text content and one for the image. With this layout I was struggling to format my flexboxes. After looking back at some previous exercises I had done, I nested another div around the content. So now the hero section had the "hero" div and a div that acted as a wrapper around the content itself.

## Things I Can Improve

To better simplify my CSS code, I could have used a grouping selector for elements that shared certain properties or styles. Such as the elements that shared a background color, a font color, or width/height. I also couldn't get wrapping to work for the information section and decided to leave it as is, as I was spending too much time trying to get it to work.
